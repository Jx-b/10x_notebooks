Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from a healthy donor cells were stained with a panel of 31 TotalSeq™-B antibodies (BioLegend). PBMCs are primary cells with relatively small amounts of RNA (~1pg RNA/cell).
 
Libraries were prepared following the Chromium Single Cell 3ʹ Reagent Kits v3 with Feature Barcoding technology for Cell Surface Protein User Guide (CG000185 RevB).
 
5,247 cells detected
Sequenced on Illumina NovaSeq with approximately 28,918 reads per cell
28bp read1 (16bp Chromium barcode and 12bp UMI), 91bp read2 (transcript), and 8bp I7 sample barcode
run with --expect-cells=5000
